# windows-python-keylogger
A toy Python keylogger implemented through ctypes

## About

This is a keyboard monitor written in vanilla python, no dependencies. It uses SetWindowsHook to monitor keystrokes.

It was written because its a nice, tight example of callback functionality for the Windows API implemented in Python, and is more for my personal reference
